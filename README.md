    2. locally in terminal, create and cd into a new folder.
    3. in new folder: git clone ssh key here

2. Install
    1. cd into client: cd client

These start commands should open a browser window with the address http://localhost:3000/ with the app now available to use.

# What is it?
Learning Box is the result of a group project of three people selected by the class tutors at CodeClan. The brief was handed to us on the Thursday afternoon and submission was noon the following Wednesday.

# The brief
The brief was to create a prototype of an interactive browser application that displays educational information in a fun and interesting way. The app must use an API or database.

The tech stack is:
* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* Node.js
* JavaScript

# Planning
The group used Agile working methods, met daily for stand ups, and worked through tasks organised on a Trello board. Below are one each of our user stories and wireframes from the start of the project.
Features branches were created to work on tasks locally.
